# ReserveIt

ReserveIt is a web application that allows users to manage corporate resource reservations such as conference rooms. The system consists of a Symfony-based API and a Next.js frontend, providing a seamless experience for managing rooms and their reservations based on calendar view.
Conference rooms are stored in the database, and notifications about new reservations are sent using RabbitMQ. 

All custom code are provided in Symfony bundle and Next.js app.

Symfony is used as REST API to manage resources, while Next.js is used to provide a user-friendly interface based on calendar view for creating and managing reservations.
All operations (create, read, update, delete) are handled through the API, and the validation of the data is done on the backend.
Frontend is built using Next.js, providing a modern and responsive user interface based on calendar view to manage reservations.

## Features
